Check back every Mondays and Fridays for new articles that challenge your mind as an early stage founder.</p>\r\n<p>Our first post this quarter is from our 0 to 1 session on Storytelling which featured Blessing Abeng and David Hundeyin. 0 to 1 holds from 7:00pm WAT every Friday on Twitter Spaces.

Blessing and David shared so many insightful and practical tips that we couldn’t help but make it into a blog post.</p>\r\n<p>Read on to have your mind blown…<span id=\"more-9881\"></span></p>\r\n<p><em>Startups can no longer afford to be faceless in a highly competitive ecosystem<strong>. </strong>Startups must convey their stories with empathy and connect deeper with their target audience to survive.</em></p>\r\n<p><strong>What is Storytelling?</strong><br>\r\nStorytelling is when you pass across the most incredible amount of information in the fewest possible words.</p>\r\n<p>As a startup founder, if you are trying to include storytelling in your growth strategy, you must have a realistic understanding of what storytelling is. Storytelling metrics are not equivalent to sales metrics. Different goals exist within storytelling. These goals include awareness, perception building, trust-building, and education.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How do you know what Stories to tell as an early-stage startup?</strong></p>\r\n<p>People know their problems; they may not know how to articulate them. By asking better questions and listening to what is said and unsaid, you will be able to extract what is essential to them and their pain points, and you will be able to make stories out of that. Many startups use surveys in research, but a better way to get answers from people is through conversations. Have conversations, prioritize conversations too, listen and also tell.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How do you tell your story as an Early Stage Startup?</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Set goals</strong><br>\r\nFounders must be specific about what goal they want their startup to achieve with storytelling specifically. For starters, an early stage Startup would prioritize awareness and perception building.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Have Conversations</strong><br>\r\nSurveys may not bring out the accurate data you need, so you must engage in conversations. Listen to what is said and unsaid.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Be empathetic</strong><br>\r\nStories that hold <strong>Top of Mind Awareness</strong> are the ones that connect to people’s pain points.<br>\r\nSharing your target audience’s pain points is one way to show empathy.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Write, publish and iterate</strong><br>\r\nThere is no formula to storytelling. Experiment, do trial and error and iterate from what is not working to what is producing results.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Conversations fuel life. If your story is good enough, it will come up in conversations. Tell stories that emphasize how your startup solves people’s problems.<!--more--></p>\r\n<div class=\"fm fn fo fp fq l\">\r\n<div class=\"o dd\">\r\n<div class=\"ds ea fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz\">\r\n<article>\r\n<div class=\"l\">\r\n<div class=\"l\">\r\n<section>\r\n<div>\r\n<div class=\"ir is it iu iv\">\r\n<p id=\"df1e\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph kj kk iy kl b km kn ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc ld le lf lg ir ha\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">There you have it,<br>\r\n<strong>You need to tell your story to survive as a startup</strong><br>\r\nI hope this has helped you<br>\r\nHave anything to add?

He has transitioned through different markets in his corporate career and was previously Head of Corporate Communications at VConnect Global Services.<br>\r\nRead on for a snippet of our podcast session with Chima talking about what to focus on when trying to acquire users</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Pick A Niche</strong><br>\r\nBefore selecting a niche:<br>\r\n– Explore values that can be retained over a period of time<br>\r\n– Offer something people already want and will come to you for<br>\r\n– Find a place where you can scale</li>\r\n<li><strong>Key into Branding</strong><br>\r\nThe first thing for you as a business is to be perceived right by your prospective customers. The right perception leads to engagement. Brand like you are multinational before you even start selling and you will have an edge.<p></p>\r\n<blockquote><p>Your branding attracts people to you.</p></blockquote>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Who Are You Trying To Attract?</strong><br>\r\nYou need to think of who your message is for, the ideal customer for your product. You can’t create for everyone — this will make your message unclear and confuse your customers. Focus on one thing, build on it and find customers for it.<p></p>\r\n<blockquote><p>Don’t try to build for everyone</p></blockquote>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Where Can You Find Them?</strong><br>\r\nWhere is this person at? Look for communities where you can communicate directly with your target audience. “Infiltrate” these communities strategically to get their trust.<p></p>\r\n<blockquote><p>People buy from those they trust.</p></blockquote>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Word of Mouth</strong><br>\r\nTreat your customers right and they will refer other people to you. Customers will be more willing to share your business with others if they had a good experience working with you. Get your product and your customer service right.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Topnotch Communication — Don’t try to push the brand first</strong><br>\r\nYou know who your customers are, you know where they are at, now you need to talk to them the way they understand. Talk to them as an individual that knows them. Let your personality shine through in your communication.<p></p>\r\n<blockquote><p>You have to build trust around yourself as an individual in the startup.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>It is easier for new customers to connect with you as an individual than to connect with the brand . At the early stage, it has to be you and your person that they like, and as the company grows to a larger organisation, they start to connect with the brand as beyond the individual</p></li>\r\n<li><strong>Market! Market!! Market!!!</strong><br>\r\nAt the early stage, you don’t have a lot of money but you need to get your product out there. You have to balance out paid advertising and organic content creation to effectively reach your customers at this stage.<br>\r\nPeople have to see your product to know if they like it or love it before wanting it.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>His Final Words<br>\r\nPut your leg in the deep end first, get customers, get money. You are building a business, you need traction and traction equals money. Find a way to be stable as an individual building a product.Scaling, Perfection and Aesthetics should be secondary to making money.</p>\r\n<p>There you have it<br>\r\n<strong>Do you know who you are building for?</strong><br>\r\nListen to the full podcast <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/7y8vfswCXYU9BSPbuTFqxv?si=JxXwpZZnTsCzMJsfUxvw5A&amp;utm_source=copy-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HERE</a><br>\r\nYou can connect with Chima on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/chima-ezeokoye\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Linkedin</a> and <a href=\"https://instagram.com/keec_20?utm_medium=copy_link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram</a><br>\r\nI hope this has helped you<br>\r\nWhat did you learn?

He is a designer and marketing specialist at the core. When he’s not working, Bolu spends time watching soccer. He’s an avid Chelsea FC supporter and is based in Lagos, Nigeria.<br>\r\nHe shares some of his biggest takeaways from being in the startup space. You definitely want to implement some of his advice.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>First Attempt At Being A Founder</strong><br>\r\nMy first startup was founded in 2015 and was called PINFOOT. We were trying to create a social media platform, a fusion of Twitter and Instagram for football lovers. Worked on it but it didn’t work out.<br>\r\nTook a break from being a founder after that and went into digital marketing and some other things. Last year I picked it back up and started working on <a href=\"https://storemia.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Storemia</a>, an easy and fast way to create an ecommerce store, for small businesses.<br>\r\nTakeaways From My Experience in the Startup Space</p>\r\n<p>I have learnt a lot of things being in this space, but the things that really stand out and I will advise anyone to do are:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Launch fast.</strong><br>\r\nA lot of people call themselves founders but don’t have a product out. Find a way to build your product fast. It doesn’t need to have all the beautiful things you want from day 1, work on your MVP (Minimum Viable Product), get into the market, then continue to build on it over time.</li>\r\n<li><strong>&nbsp;Don’t be too attached to your product.</strong><br>\r\nAlways look at the problem – what are you solving?<p></p>\r\n<blockquote><p><strong>Be more focused on the problem you are trying to solve than “your solution” to said problem.</strong></p></blockquote>\r\n<p>For example, if you need footwear for soccer and I design a sandal. Of course, a sandal isn’t right for football. After getting that feedback, my job is to find a different solution to the problem, in this case, design a boot. A lot of people are so fixated on their solution to the problem that they get too attached and lose focus on the actual problem.</p>\r\n<p>Your product might not be the exact solution to the problem, it might be close but not be “it”, so don’t get too attached. Once the target market says they don’t want what you are building, quickly ask them for what they want and go and work on that.</p></li>\r\n<li><strong>Iterate</strong><br>\r\nHave a culture of writing codes in your company, a culture of building a lot, then you can find a solution to the problem faster and more efficiently. This ties in with the above points, the more you build, the earlier you launch, and the closer you are to getting to the solution needed. Don’t be too caught up in your solution.<br>\r\nIf you don’t launch fast, you will be too caught up in your solution and if you don’t already have the culture of building and iterating, you will be reluctant to keep at it.<br>\r\nIf you spend 10 months building a solution that your audience does not want, you will feel very reluctant to build something else</li>\r\n<li><strong>Work with smart people</strong><br>\r\nIf you are working in a tech startup, try as much as possible to have someone in your team that can code. If you have to contract it out, you will most likely build more slowly than if you were to have that skill in your team. I personally have a bias against having no one that can code in your tech startup team. It is a “tech” team, someone needs to know how the system is actually run.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Do the actual work of providing a solution</strong><br>\r\nHave a culture of doing the work and not just looking smart. Put in the work required to solve the problem. The branding shouldn’t be more than the work on the actual product you put out there.<p></p>\r\n<blockquote><p>The branding shouldn’t be more than the work</p></blockquote>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Be a feedback oriented company</strong><br>\r\nInteract with your customers, engage with them and get feedback. There are chances that you have done something they don’t like or there is something they like that you haven’t done so talk to them to know how to improve. When someone criticizes something you are doing, take the criticism, move on and work on it.<p></p>\r\n<blockquote><p>A feedback on your product is not an insult to your intelligence. It is just the the fact about what they need</p></blockquote>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There you have it,<br>\r\n<strong>The problem comes first, not you, not even your solution. The Problem!</strong><br>\r\nI hope this has helped you.</p>\r\n<p>What did you learn?

He has dedicated the past 5 years of his life working with millennials who desire to transition from their reality to their productivity. He has worked across multiple industries and sectors. Victor’s work cut across several expressions like coaching, strategy, training and mentorship.</p>\r\n<p>He shared with us how a large team can cripple execution when starting out</p>\r\n<p>After interacting with over 100 African entrepreneurs (mostly Nigerians though) and uncovered a critical problem of disorganization, I began designing a solution for early stage startup entrepreneurs in Africa. I called this solution Talem Business School. I had called a team of 5 professionals, and together we began working on this solution in June 2019. We went live with a blast launch in August 2020. I was so excited that we finally have a dedicated business school for startups in Africa designed to only solve the problem of structure through learning. With time we grew to 11-team of professionals handling different aspects of Talem Business School</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In October 2020, I began rethinking a lot of things. I had to reinvent how we wanted to solve this problem of structure among startups in Africa. First thing that hit me hard was ‘’Startups NEED structure but do not WANT structure when starting out’’. That’s a bit mind boggling. It was hard to be emotionally disconnected from something we had spent about 12 months working on. This is what we call a ‘’PIVOT’’. I may write about pivoting if I get another opportunity to be featured here.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There was however an underlying critical issue that deeply affected the growth of Talem Business School. This affected how we made decisions and most importantly ‘’EXECUTION’’ which is the biggest win for any early stage entrepreneurs. If you cannot execute, then you have no business. We found it very hard to move from zero to one because we had a large team for a company literally in its baby stage. It was hard to move quickly and even fail forward with 11 people on the team. The folks weren’t on payroll. It was voluntary. The first big decision I had to take was letting go of 60% of the team. It was my first challenging decision. I had to let good talented people go. There are times you have to say goodbye to “great things’’ if you really want to grow and scale. Things got a bit better when we dropped to a 5-team of professionals. However, with time, I had to let everyone go as we needed to make a 360 degrees pivot which led to building ‘’Talemia’’ with the same singular purpose but on a different model and expression.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If you are at the stage of developing your idea or even your MVP, the worst decision you can ever make is to add unnecessary weight to your business by bringing in talents. Talents are good but it needs to be done at the appropriate time. As an early stage startup founder, you must wear many hats while building. Get involved in Product Design and Development, Sales and Marketing, Customer Acquisition, Operations, Pitching and Funding. This will give you a bird’s eye view of the solution you’re building while setting the right environment on which you will infuse your startup culture.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There you have it,<br>\r\n<strong>Build Lean, Fail Fast, Learn Quickly and Grow</strong><br>\r\nI hope this has helped you<br>\r\nWhat did you learn?

Most of the time, I am listening to their ideas or looking at their product viability. The thing with the concept of idea is that almost everybody has one. Ideas are now easy to come by. We have become so emotionally attached to ideas that we forget the most critical player in the game – The Market [Users]. Oftentimes, people chat me up and say they’ve got this lofty and beautiful idea. Before they go on to share with so much excitement, I remind them that ideas are validated by the market and not the founder.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having a lofty idea doesn’t guarantee building a great company. As lofty as your idea may be, there may be no market for such an idea. It’s important for&nbsp; early stage founders to detach emotionally from their ideas and think in terms of what the market needs at a particular time. It’s smarter to find a problem and build your solution around it than building a solution and looking for the problem</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ideas will always keep pouring in, especially when you’ve got an entrepreneurial mindset but you need to audit each idea and assess the level of its viability. I personally coined a term for it – ‘’Idea-Problem fit’’. Your idea has to fit into an identified problem area. This is the bulk of work we spend time doing at Talemia, helping African founders in their earliest stage launch their startups faster than they can on their own.

Our solution is to provide quick, healthy and affordable coffee drinks to campus students to keep them active, woke, and energetic as they study to achieve their career aspirations.</p>\r\n<p>Beyond just selling coffee, we are building a community of coffee lovers that share their positive stories as a tool to conquer depression among young people because coffee is an element of positivity. We started out as an idea in February 2021, looking out how we can present coffee in a better way that is quick, affordable, and healthy to young people (Our target market).</p>\r\n<p>In April 2021, we put out our first MVP to students at University of Uyo, Nigeria. We had a little setback as there were lots of pivoting and iterations to do. Everyone wanted different things at the same time. Although these are things we could handle, we didn’t have required funds at our disposal.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9674 size-full\" src=\"./assets/image/thegiverscoffe-image.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"819\" ></p>\r\n<p>By June 2021, I joined Buildr, a community product by Talemia that supports early stage African founders to transform their ideas into viable businesses. They had one singular one –<strong> to take founders on a journey from 0 to 1.</strong></p>\r\n<p>Talemia has a weekly fast paced knowledge session on Clubhouse where we had free access to established founders and key players in the startup space. I truly wanted to move TheGivers Coffee from 0 to 1, so I participated in most of these sessions which I found really invaluable. We covered things like <strong>Bootstrapping, Hiring, Legal Structure, MVP Development, Social Capital, Funding, Agile Leadership, Startup Mistakes, Personal Branding, etc</strong></p>\r\n<p>In August 2021 at Buildr, we were exposed to the reality of equity and the rule of law involving shares and percentages in business between founders, co-founders, and investors. I doubled down on execution with my solution. We were able to gain more traction, and we secured our first coffee shop in October 2021.</p>\r\n<p>In November 2021 through Talemia’s partnership network (Treayos Digital), we developed our website with a fully integrated payment gateway and relaunched TheGivers Coffee to the larger public. This means that we are now ready to start taking orders right from our website. That was some 0 to 1 move for us!!!</p>\r\n<p>In December 2021, our customer base grew by <strong>35%</strong> and we currently have <strong>3 signature products</strong> while working on more new recipes. We have also secured <strong>2 retail shop outlets</strong>. We look forward to adding 3 more new retail shop outlets, growing our team to 1<strong>5 superhumans</strong> and also increasing customer retainership rate by <strong>70%</strong> in Q1/2022. I am particularly thrilled at the many more milestones we’d hit through the support of Buildr and the entire team of Talemia. Joining Buildr was my biggest business investment in 2021. You should join us too if you desire to move from 0 to 1.</p>\r\n	</div>', '', 'yes', 0),
